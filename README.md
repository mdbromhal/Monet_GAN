## Explanation of Code (more explanations in ipynb file)
- Basically, there's a generator and a discriminator in a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)
- Takes in landscape photographs and images of Monet's paintings
- The generator and discriminator train each other and work together to make an image that combines the photograph with Monet's style

### Example:

Monet painting:

Landscape photograph:

**And the GAN will combine these to make its own image in Monet's style**
