 ABSTRACT: Paint Like Monet: Two-Objective Discriminator GAN to Mimic Monetâ€™s Painting Style
 
## Sources:
- Based on Kaggle Competition: I'm Something of a Painter Myself (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started/overview)

- Data from: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started/data (For storage purposes, I have not included the images in this repo; use the link to download the image directories from Kaggle)

## Explanation of Code (more explanations in ipynb file)
- Basically, there's a generator and a discriminator in a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)
- Takes in landscape photographs and images of Monet's paintings
- The generator and discriminator train each other and work together to make an image that combines the photograph with Monet's style

### Example:

Monet painting:

Landscape photograph:

**And the GAN will combine these to make its own image in Monet's style**
